# SE577SoftwareAchitecture

My name is Mohamed Ahmed. I am a first year online graduate student at Drexel.

I got my undergrad from Drexel in Chemical Engineering with a Computer Science Minor.

I want to continue down the CS/SE path. I am specially interested in Machine Learning.

My graduate degree is in Machine Learning.

From my research, I can confirm that there is significant overlap between SE and ML engineering.

I want to learn SE concepts including architecture in order to perform my duties well as an ML engineer.

I am currently employed with Comcast as a Software Engineer full time. I am hopping to apply the skills
I learn in this class to do better at my job and for future positions.
